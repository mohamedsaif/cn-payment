# Cloud Native Payment

Simple cashless payment application that demonstrate various aspect of secure cloud native application development, deployment and operations.

Motivation behind this project:

- Support for hybrid deployment with minimum administration overhead
- Elastic scale (both apps and data)
- AI infused experiences
- Security across the stack (in-transit and at rest)
- DevSecOps
- Automated IaC

## Architecture

## Technologies

Application employs microservices architecture to have modular scalable design

As I believe that developers should spent most of their time working on the core business of the application, I've delegated mundane required tasks to established frameworks and technologies to assist in keeping the primary focus on **writing the core logic code**
